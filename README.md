Interactive Viewer for Li-6400xt Files

The Li-COR Li-6400xt Portable Photosynthesis System measures photosynthesis and stomatal conductance using infrared gas analyzers.
The Fluorometer head measures several chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and derives more from raw values. Additionally, they crammed just about every 
sensor imaginable into this thing so the files are a royal pain to look at. I built this viewer to easily visualize the thousands of data points collected
from our dry-down experiments in the "rage_cage", our homemade growth chamber. Water was withheld from pre-flowering Maize plants until embolism was observed using the optical method in upper leaves, then plants were watered and the recovery of photosynthetic parameters was observed.
